# White Flag Project by /r/Malaysia üá≤üáæ üè≥Ô∏è
This is the official repository for the [White Flag Project by /r/malaysia](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/oir4za/rmalaysias_white_flag_project_your_help_needed_on/) website.
# About the project
In July 2021, during the Extended Movement Control Order (EMCO) in Malaysia, the COVID pandemic was at its worst in Malaysia. The country had been under lockdown for a month, and with COVID cases rising and no end in sight, many lost their jobs and were unable to eat. From there, the White Flag movement was born, a nationwide movement which had a simple goal: if you are in need of help, raise a white flag, and people will provide you with what they can, no questions asked.

Thousands across the country sought to help, from small businesses to Members of Parliament (MPs). Many set up food banks, eager to help out those who were most in need.

There was one problem: there was no centralised platform for people to advertise their foodbanks. Seeing this need, the /r/malaysia White Flag Project was born to consolidate data on foodbank locations and availability in a central location, especially so that data consumers such as [Kita Jaga](https://www.kitajaga.co) and [Sambal Sos](https://www.sambalsos.com) can consume detailed, enriched, high-quality data.
# Progress
Currently, we have a static website to act as our online identity, and as a place where data consumers can get links to the data
